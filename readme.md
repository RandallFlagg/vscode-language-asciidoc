# AsciiDoc(tor) Language Package for VSCode

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to AsciiDoc(tor) files. Supports [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/)-specific features.

**NOTE:** This package recognizes the modern AsciiDoc syntax endorsed by Asciidoctor. It does not support the legacy AsciiDoc syntax permitted by Asciidoctor with [compat mode](http://asciidoctor.org/docs/migration/#compat-mode) enabled or by AsciiDoc Python. Additionally, two-line section titles are _not recognized_ by this package since they confuse both the language highlighter and the writer.


## File extension support

The default file extensions for AsciiDoc files are _ad_, _asc_, _adoc_, _asciidoc_, and _adoc.txt_.
